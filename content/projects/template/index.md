# 🚀 How to Create Your First Project

Welcome! This is a template to help you showcase your first project. Simply:

1. **Copy this folder** (`content/projects/template/`)
2. **Rename it** to match your project (e.g., `my-awesome-app`)
3. **Edit this file** with your project details
4. **Add images** to the `assets/` folder (especially `thumbnail.jpg`)
5. **Run** `npm run build` to generate JSON
6. **Preview** your project at `http://localhost:8080/projects.html`

## 📋 Frontmatter Explained

At the top of this file, you'll see the frontmatter (between the `---` markers). Here's what each field does:

```yaml
---
title: "Project Name"                  # Required - project title
description: "Brief description"       # Required - shown in project cards
technologies: ["React", "Node.js"]     # Required - tech stack tags
github: "https://github.com/..."       # Optional - GitHub repo URL
demo: "https://demo.com"               # Optional - live demo URL
thumbnail: "assets/thumbnail.jpg"      # Required - preview image
featured: true                         # Optional - show on homepage
date: "2024-01-15"                     # Optional - project completion date
---
```

**Important:** The `thumbnail` is required and should be a representative image of your project!

## 🖼️ Adding Images

### Thumbnail Image (Required!)

Create a thumbnail for your project card:

```markdown
---
